# Logo Generation Prompt for AI Image Generator

Use this prompt with AI image generation tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or similar services.

## Primary Prompt - Docling Style

```
Create a logo for "DFGviz" (DataFlow Graph Visualizer) in the style of the docling logo. The logo should feature:

- A circular icon with a cartoonish, friendly creature's head (similar to docling's duckling style)
- The creature should have two small, dark, round eyes
- Instead of holding a document, the creature should hold a dataflow graph visualization in the center
- The graph should be white/light colored and show nodes and edges (like a network diagram)
- The creature's head should be orange-brown or warm-toned (similar to docling's color scheme)
- The overall style should be cute, friendly, and approachable
- Background: Transparent or solid color circle
- Format: Square aspect ratio (1:1), 512x512px minimum
- The creature should look happy and friendly, holding the graph visualization proudly
- Style: Flat design, clean lines, modern and professional
- Color palette: Warm orange-brown for creature, white/light gray for graph, dark accents for eyes
```

## Alternative Prompt - More Specific

```
Design a logo in docling's style: A cute cartoon creature (duckling-like) with two small dark round eyes, holding a white dataflow graph (nodes and edges) in the center of its face. The creature should be orange-brown colored, friendly and approachable. Circular icon format, transparent background, flat design style, 512x512px. For "DFGviz" - DataFlow Graph Visualizer.
```

## Design Elements

1. **Creature Style**: Similar to docling's duckling - cute, friendly, cartoonish
2. **Graph Element**: Instead of document, show a dataflow graph with:
   - 3-5 nodes (circles/dots)
   - Connecting edges (lines)
   - Simple network diagram appearance
3. **Color Scheme**: Match docling's warm orange-brown tones
4. **Expression**: Happy, friendly, holding graph proudly
5. **Background**: Transparent or subtle solid color

## Tools Recommended

- **DALL-E 3** (OpenAI) - Best for following style references
- **Midjourney** - Good for artistic styles
- **Stable Diffusion** - For fine control
- **Adobe Firefly** - For commercial use
- **Canva AI** (for refinement)

## Post-Generation Steps

After generating the logo:

1. **Save as PNG** with transparent background
2. **Resize** to 512x512px for `docs/logo.png`
3. **Create variations**:
   - 256x256px for smaller uses
   - 1024x1024px for high-resolution displays
   - Favicon version (32x32px or 64x64px)
4. **Test visibility** at different sizes
5. **Add to repository** in `docs/logo.png`

## Reference Style

The logo should match the friendly, approachable style of docling:
- Cute cartoon creature
- Holding a relevant object (graph instead of document)
- Warm, friendly colors
- Professional yet approachable
- Clean, modern design

## Notes

- The logo should be distinctive and memorable
- Should work well at small sizes (favicon, app icon)
- Must maintain clarity when scaled down
- Should convey "dataflow analysis" while being friendly and approachable
- Consider creating a monochrome version for single-color printing
